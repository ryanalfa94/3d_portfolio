        </h2>

        Iâ€™m driven by a love for building tools that solve real problems.
        Anime fuels my creativity and pushes me to think beyond conventional limits.
        My workout discipline strengthens the consistency and focus I bring into debugging and backend logic.
        Traveling opens me up to new ideas and cultures, while soccer sharpens my teamwork and adaptability.
        These passions shape the way I think, collaborate, and grow as a developer.
